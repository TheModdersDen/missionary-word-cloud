# Missionary Word Cloud

A python script to generate a word cloud image out of a set of emails

## What does it do?

It takes a certain set of credentials and inputs, from a file called '.env' in the root of the program folder, and generates a [word cloud](https://boostlabs.com/what-are-word-clouds-value-simple-visualizations/) from a set of emails that it retrieves from Google's Email servers...

## Why did you make it?

This project was created as a personal, pet, project so that I could have a word cloud to be displayed for a relative who was coming home from a mission. I subsequently thought that it would be useful for others who mighe be doing the same.

## How can I use it?
